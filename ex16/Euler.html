            The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century,
            <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he
            studied under another giant of mathematics, Jean Bernoulli. In 1731 Euler became
            a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler
            was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books
            and papers. His influence was felt in physics and astronomy as well. Euler’s work
            on mathematical analysis,
            <i>Introductio in analysin infinitorum</i> (1748) remained a standard textbook
            for well over a century. For other problems of Analysis Euler wrote
            <i>Lettres à une princesse d’Allemagne</i> (1768-1772), giving a clear non-technical
            outline of the main physical theories of the time.

            One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Notations still in use today, such as e and pi, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps best known for his research into mathematical analysis. Euler's formula

            and elegant statement.

            Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and
            certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.
